    "### **Problem Introduction**\n",
    "This experiment seeks to test whether STA130 students can correctly identify whether tea or milk was poured first in a cup of tea, echoing Ronald Fisher's famous tea-tasting experiment with Dr. Muriel Bristol. The original experiment aimed to evaluate Dr. Bristol's claim that she could distinguish between cups based on the pouring sequence, while our goal is to assess whether the students’ ability to guess correctly exceeds random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Relationship Between This Experiment and Fisher’s Original Experiment**\n",
    "- In the original experiment, Fisher tested whether Dr. Bristol could reliably identify the sequence of tea-making by tasting. Fisher set up a controlled experiment with 8 cups of tea, half prepared by adding milk first and the other half by adding tea first.\n",
    "- In the STA130 student experiment, we expand the sample to 80 students and simplify the setup by having each student taste just one cup of tea.\n",
    "- Both experiments aim to test a hypothesis of random guessing versus a detectable difference in taste based on the sequence of preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Statements of the Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Null Hypothesis (\\( H_0 \\)):**\n",
    "The null hypothesis states that students are merely guessing when identifying whether milk or tea was poured first. The population parameter of interest is the probability that a student guesses correctly by chance, which is \\( p = 0.5 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal version:**\n",
    "- \\( H_0: p = 0.5 \\), where \\( p \\) is the proportion of students who correctly identify the sequence purely by random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Informal version:**\n",
    "- The null hypothesis suggests that students cannot truly taste a difference between pouring sequences and are just as likely to guess correctly as incorrectly, with a 50/50 chance of getting it right.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Alternative Hypothesis (\\( H_A \\)):**\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis suggests that students are better than random chance at identifying whether the milk or tea was poured first.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal version:**\n",
    "- \\( H_A: p > 0.5 \\), where \\( p \\) is the proportion of students who can correctly identify the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Informal version:**\n",
    "- The alternative hypothesis claims that students are not just guessing, but have a better-than-random ability to identify the pouring sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Quantitative Analysis**\n",
    "We will use a hypothesis test for a population proportion to assess whether 49 out of 80 correct responses are significantly different from what we would expect under random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Observed Test Statistic**:\n",
    "   - Sample proportion: \\( \\hat{p} = \\frac{49}{80} = 0.6125 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Null Hypothesis Sampling Distribution**:\n",
    "   Under the null hypothesis, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion \\( \\hat{p} \\) is approximately normal (due to the Central Limit Theorem) with:\n",
    "   - Mean: \\( \\mu_{\\hat{p}} = p_0 = 0.5 \\)\n",
    "   - Standard Error: \\( \\text{SE}_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5(0.5)}{80}} \\approx 0.0559 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Statistic (z-score)**:\n",
    "   The z-score compares how far the observed sample proportion is from the null hypothesis proportion in terms of standard errors:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\text{SE}_{\\hat{p}}} = \\frac{0.6125 - 0.5}{0.0559} \\approx 2.01\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **P-value**:\n",
    "   The p-value corresponds to the probability of observing a z-score of 2.01 or greater under the null hypothesis. From standard normal tables, the p-value is approximately \\( 0.0222 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Interpretation**:\n",
    "- A p-value of 0.0222 means there is about a 2.22% chance of observing a sample result as extreme as ours (or more extreme) if students were merely guessing. \n",
    "- Since the p-value is less than the common significance level of \\( \\alpha = 0.05 \\), we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that students may indeed have some ability to detect the correct pouring sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Supporting Visualizations** (Optional)\n",
    "A plot of the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, showing where our observed test statistic falls, can help visualize the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Findings and Discussion**\n",
    "- **Conclusion Regarding the Null Hypothesis**:\n",
    "   Based on the p-value (0.0222), we reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that the STA130 students may have some genuine ability to identify the pouring sequence better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discussion**:\n",
    "   Although the result is statistically significant, this experiment doesn't necessarily imply that all students have an inherent ability to detect the difference in pouring sequence. Other factors like chance, prior knowledge, or the experimental setup could influence the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "In conclusion, our statistical analysis indicates that STA130 students perform better than random guessing when identifying whether tea or milk was poured first. However, further experiments or a larger sample size might be necessary to confirm these findings and generalize them to other populations.\n",
