    "### For Question 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this question is to explore the differences between two lines on a plot: one that reflects a fitted model based on sample data and one that represents a theoretical trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adding the Theoretical Line to the Plot**:\n",
    "   By appending the code below to the code from Question 2, we add a second line to the plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x_range = np.array([df['x'].min(), df['x'].max()])\n",
    "   y_line = beta0 + beta1 * x_range\n",
    "   fig.add_scatter(x=x_range, y=y_line, mode='lines',\n",
    "                   name=str(beta0)+' + '+str(beta1)+' * x', \n",
    "                   line=dict(dash='dot', color='orange'))\n",
    "   fig.show(renderer=\"png\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This line (`y = beta0 + beta1 * x`) represents a theoretical relationship defined by the parameters `beta0` and `beta1`. This line is constant across all simulations because it is based on fixed parameters, not the data sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explaining the Difference**:\n",
    "   - The **fitted line** from Question 2 is derived from the actual sample data, meaning it adjusts based on the observed data points and thus incorporates random sampling variation.\n",
    "   - The **theoretical line** from Question 1, however, represents a predefined model expectation and remains consistent across simulations. This line is effectively the \"true\" trend, or how we would expect the relationship between `x` and `y` to look without any random sampling variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Purpose of Repeated Visualization**:\n",
    "   Repeatedly simulating different datasets and visualizing these two lines shows how sampling variation affects the fitted line. While the theoretical line remains unchanged, the fitted line fluctuates slightly in each simulation. This fluctuation illustrates **random sampling variation**: the idea that sample data may not perfectly represent the underlying theoretical trend due to inherent randomness in sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the two lines across multiple simulations, we can observe the stability of the theoretical line and the variability in the fitted line, underscoring how sample-specific randomness impacts statistical modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Observations:\n",
    "- **Theoretical line**: Represents a consistent, ideal trend.\n",
    "- **Fitted line**: Varies due to random sampling effects.\n",
    "- **Overall insight**: This exercise visually demonstrates how random sampling variation influences the fitted model, highlighting the concept that sample data can differ from theoretical expectations.\n",

    "### Answer for Question 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this question is to deepen our understanding of how sample data and theoretical models interact in data visualization, specifically examining the effects of random sampling variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding the Visual Difference**:\n",
    "   In this question, we’ve added a theoretical line defined by the formula `y = beta0 + beta1 * x` alongside the fitted line from the sample data. The fitted line, calculated from the data sample, changes slightly with each new dataset due to random sampling variation. In contrast, the theoretical line remains stable because it’s based on fixed coefficients, representing the \"true\" underlying model expectation without the influence of sample-specific randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Purpose of the Visualization**:\n",
    "   By plotting these two lines together across repeated simulations, we visually observe how sampling variation affects the fitted model. The variation in the fitted line across simulations reflects the inherent randomness in sample data, demonstrating that a single sample may not perfectly capture the underlying theoretical trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Takeaway**:\n",
    "   This exercise illustrates an essential statistical concept: **random sampling variation**. When we sample data, the results may fluctuate around the true model, and this randomness impacts our model fit. Visualizing the fitted line alongside the stable theoretical line allows us to better understand how closely our sample-based model aligns with theoretical expectations and underscores the importance of considering sampling variation in real-world data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this comparison of lines serves as a practical reminder that sample data is inherently variable, and the true underlying model may differ slightly from sample-based models due to random sampling effects.\n",
